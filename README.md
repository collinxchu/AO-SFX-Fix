# AO-SFX-Fix
Time to fix this shit.

This repo is for the following:

Renaming SFX:
  
  Currently, sfx are all over the place in terms of naming conventions.
  We are updating to the following format.
  
  GAME-EFFECT-MODIFIER-NUMBER
  Any generic effect without a game will be kept as "sfx-[name]".
  
  EX:
  DD-stab
  DGS-Mae-Guilty
  AA-Deskslam
  SFX-chocolatemilk

Fixing SFX:

  In short, many of the current sound effects are radically louder or quieter than the 'mean' of effect amplitudes.
  This will be remedied.

We are doing this both for ease of use and for user experience.
